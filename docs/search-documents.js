Hover the mouse over the diagram elements above for short descriptions (tooltips), click to navigate to element pages with more details. The above diagram is conceptual - it shows only the most important classes and relationships. The generated UML class diagram provides more details. Hover the mouse over diagram elements for tooltips, click to navigate to class/feature pages. You can also use the default graph and other graphs to quickly grasp relationships of the model elements. Hover the mouse over graph nodes for tooltips and to highlight their reated classes. Drag to rearrange, double-click to navigate to class pages. It can also be used as a starting point for an organization-specific documentation - make a copy or fork, modify descriptions of model elements. For example, add links to catalogs of internal knowledge sources or approved/available LLMs and their configurations. Similarly, you may have a catalog of reusable agents or guardrails. You may also have organization-specific development guidelines with references to shared libraries and internal productivity tools such as code generators, wizards, IDE plugins, training resources, &hellip; However, the main objective of the model is to serve as an intermediary for code generation. The model can be populated from diagrams and other data sources. Then it produces a python model and, finally, Python sources and supporting artifacts. The model can be created from Drawio diagrams using exeutable diagrams or semantic mapping. You can find an example of programmatic population of a model here. The below code snippet shows how to generate a python source file and configuration files using CrewGenerator: CapabilityLoader capabilityLoader = new CapabilityLoader();\nProgressMonitor progressMonitor = new PrintStreamProgressMonitor();\nRequirement&lt;ResourceSetRequirement, ResourceSet&gt; requirement = ServiceCapabilityFactory.createRequirement(ResourceSet.class);\nResourceSet resourceSet = capabilityLoader.loadOne(requirement, progressMonitor);\n\nFile crewSourceFile = new File(&quot;target/latest-ai-developments/src/crew.py&quot;).getCanonicalFile();\nURI crewSourceURI = URI.createFileURI(crewSourceFile.getAbsolutePath());\nCrewGenerator crewGenerator = new CrewGenerator();\ncrewGenerator.generate(\n\t\tcreateCrew(),\n\t\tcrewSourceURI,\n\t\tresourceSet,\n\t\tprogressMonitor);\n You can override CrewGenerator methods to customize the generation process. Documentation in this model is copied verbatim or almost verbatim from the reference documentation for the purpose of consistency. â†© Step callback Agent You can think of an agent as a specialized team member with specific skills, expertise, and responsibilities. Task A specific assignment completed by an Agent Tool A skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions Guardrail Validates and transforms task outputs A crew may use multiple LLMs: * Function calling LLM * Manager LLM * Planning LLM Step and taks callbacks Crew A group of agents working together to complete a set of tasks Large Language Model (LLM) LLMs enable agents to understand context, make decisions, and generate human-like responses Knowledge Source An external source of information which agents use to work on tasks Callback A function called after completion of tasks and steps Context Family"},"references/eClassifiers/Crew/references/eStructuralFeatures/agents/index.html":{"path":"Crew/References/agents","link-uuid":"793e2702-6024-4f7c-a290-945ad8d63196","title":"agents","content":"Agents in this crew."},"references/eClassifiers/Function/inheritance.html":{"path":"Function/Inheritance","link-uuid":"b1253eb6-bef0-435d-95c4-bf2de6cbf0d8","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes Subtypes  "},"references/eClassifiers/Agent/index.html":{"link-uuid":"2ee115d6-1864-4147-9057-5dbf8f72534a","title":"Agent","content":"An [Agent](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents) is an autonomous unit that can:\n Perform specific tasks Make decisions based on its role and goal Use tools to accomplish objectives Communicate and collaborate with other agents Maintain memory of interactions Delegate tasks when allowed"},"references/eClassifiers/Agent/inheritance.html":{"path":"Agent/Inheritance","link-uuid":"25da848a-cbf7-4cc0-bb93-48b25e3b608d","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "},"references/eClassifiers/Agent/references/eStructuralFeatures/embedder/index.html":{"path":"Agent/References/embedder","link-uuid":"dad67488-5e3a-4143-9a84-f9695bbcb85e","title":"embedder","content":"Configuration for the embedder used by the agent."},"references/eClassifiers/Crew/references/eStructuralFeatures/taskCallback/index.html":{"path":"Crew/References/taskCallback","link-uuid":"11d157fe-08e9-4ed0-8a8c-132d3a88ec8a","title":"taskCallback","content":"A function that is called after the completion of each task.
