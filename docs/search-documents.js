It forms the basis for social order. The purpose of the family is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and learn to participate in the community. Historically, most human societies use family as the primary locus of attachment, nurturance, and socialization. Anthropologists classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children), patrifocal (a father and his children), conjugal (a married couple with children, also called the nuclear family), avuncular (a man, his sister, and her children), or extended (in addition to parents and children, may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins). The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history. The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics. The word &ldquo;families&rdquo; can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village."},"references/eClassifiers/Callback/inheritance.html":{"path":"Callback/Inheritance","link-uuid":"757a400c-8723-4c91-bc50-f3038eb1947a","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "},"references/eClassifiers/Crew/inheritance.html":{"path":"Crew/Inheritance","link-uuid":"4c40ee87-86eb-42bd-823a-a75ef2fa31b2","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "}}
